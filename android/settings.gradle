// legacy settings.gradle left in place for compatibility but the project now uses
// `settings.gradle.kts` generated by `flutter create .`.
// To avoid Gradle applying Flutter's plugin loader imperatively, this file
// intentionally does not apply any scripts. The Kotlin DSL version is:
// android/settings.gradle.kts
